    "Almost all computation involves the repetition of\n",
    "steps. Iterative control statements, such as the for\n",
    "and while statements, provide one means of controlling\n",
    "the repeated execution of instructions. Another\n",
    "way is by the use of recursion.<br>\n",
    "In <i>recursive problem solving</i>, a problem is\n",
    "repeatedly broken down into similar subproblems,\n",
    "until the subproblems can be directly solved without\n",
    "further breakdown. For example, consider the\n",
    "method of searching for a name in a sorted list of\n",
    "names below.<br>\n",
    "1. If the list contains only one name, then if the\n",
    "name found is the name you are looking for,\n",
    "then terminate with “name found,” otherwise terminate with “name not found.”\n",
    "2. Otherwise, look at the middle item in the list. If that is the name you are looking for, then\n",
    "terminate with “name found.”\n",
    "3. Otherwise, continue by searching in a similar manner either the top half of the list, if the name\n",
    "you are looking for is alphabetically before the middle name of the list, or the bottom half of\n",
    "list, if the name you are looking for is alphabetically after.<br>\n",
    "The first two steps of this method are straightforward. The detail comes when the list needs to be\n",
    "continually broken down into sublists, and the appropriate sublists are searched. The beauty of recursive\n",
    "problem solving, however, is that the details of how to solve (smaller) subproblems do not\n",
    "need to be specified—the same steps that were used on the original list still apply. Although it is\n",
    "natural to try to think through all the resulting steps that are taken to recursively solve a problem, the\n",

    "## Recursive Functions\n",
    "Computational problem solving via the use of <i>recursion</i> is a powerful\n",
    "problem-solving approach. The development and use of\n",
    "recursive functions, however, requires a different perspective on\n",
    "computation than we have had so far. We discuss the design and\n",
    "use of recursive functions in this section.\n",
    "### What Is a Recursive Function?\n",
    "A <b>recursive function</b> is often defined as “a function that calls\n",
    "itself.” While this is an accepted definition, it is not necessarily the\n",
    "most appropriate explanation, for it plants in one’s mind the image\n",
    "given below.\n",
    "<img src=\"2.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The illustration in the figure depicts a function, A, that is defined at some point to call function\n",
    "A (itself). The notion of a self-referential function is inherently confusing. There are two types\n",
    "of entities related to any function however—the <i>function definition</i>, and any current <i>execution\n",
    "instances.</i><br><br>\n",
    "What is meant by the phrase “a function that calls itself ” is a function <i>execution instance</i> that\n",
    "calls another <i>execution instance</i> of the same function. A function definition is a “cookie cutter” from\n",
    "which any number of execution instances can be created. Every time a call to a function is made,\n",
    "another execution instance of the function is created. Thus, while there is only one definition for any\n",
    "function, there can be any number of execution instances. In order to fully understand the mechanism\n",
    "of recursive function calls, we first consider the general mechanism of non-recursive function\n",
    "calls as depicted in figure below.\n",
    "<img src=\"3.jpg\">\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "In the function calls in the figure, there is no trouble visualizing the sequence of events that occur.\n",
    "First, an execution instance from the definition of function A is created and begins executing. When\n",
    "the call to function B is reached, the execution instance of function A is suspended while an execution\n",
    "instance of function B is created and begins executing. In turn, when the function call to function\n",
    "C is reached, function B suspends execution while an execution instance of function C is\n",
    "created and begins executing.<br><br> This calling and suspending of executing function instances could (theoretically) continue\n",
    "indefi nitely. However, in this case, function C does not make a call to any other function. Thus, it\n",
    "simply executes until termination, returning control to the function that called it, function B.\n",
    "Function B then continues its execution until terminating, returning control to the function that\n",
    "called it, function A. Finally, function A completes and terminates, returning control to wherever\n",
    "it was called from.<br> Now, let’s consider the situation when the original function, function A, is a recursive\n",
    "function—that is, its defi nition includes a call to function A (itself). As depicted in figure below, each\n",
    "current execution instance of function A will spawn a new execution instance of function A.\n",

    "series of non-recursive instances, except that the execution instances are “clones” of each other (that\n",
    "is, of the same function definition). Thus, since all instances are identical, the function calls occur in\n",
    "exactly the same place in each.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, if the definition of a recursive function were written so that the function calls itself\n",
    "unconditionally, then every execution instance would unconditionally call another execution\n",
    "instance, ad infinitum. Such a nonterminating sequence of calls is referred to as infi nite recursion\n",
    ", similar to the notion of an infi nite loop. Therefore, properly designed recursive functions\n",
    "always conditionally call another execution instance so that eventually the chain of function\n",
    "calls terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have better understanding of recursive functions, we can use the description of a\n",
    "recursive function as “a function that calls itself,” understanding that this means that the function\n",
    "defi nition is self-referential, while the function execution instances are not. Next we will look at a\n",

    "<img src=\"12.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Thus, we can continue to develop our method for sorting lists of size n based on that fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to identify a base case that does not need to be broken down any further in\n",

    "be of size 1. Thus, the breakdown into subproblems lead towards the base case, as required.\n",

    "two lists. Whichever is the smaller value, move that as the fi rst item of a new list. Cross off the item\n",
    "moved. Continue in the same manner until all the elements have been moved to the new list. The fi rst\n",
    "steps of this process are shown in Figure below.\n",

    "Therefore, in order to effectively solve the general problem, we only need to decide and specify the\n",
    "details of step 1, how to break down a stack of disks into two separate (sub)stacks. Let’s consider\n",
    "different ways of breaking down this problem.<br>\n",
    "Suppose we start with the obvious breakdown, that is, dividing the stack of disks (six in this\n",
    "example) into two equal (or close to equal) size stacks. If we choose that approach, then after (recursively)\n",
    "moving the top half of the original stack to peg B and (recursively) moving the bottom half\n",
    "of the stack to peg C, we have the confi guration given in Figure below.\n",
    "<img src=\"22.jpg\">\n",
    "Here is where we can benefit from recursive thinking. From this confi guration, we need to (recursively)\n",
    "move the stack of disks on peg B to peg C to complete the problem solution. However, we\n",
    "are not allowed to move the whole stack at once, but instead must move each disk one at a time. This\n",
    "is accomplished by solving this problem in an identical way to the solution of the larger problem\n",
    "involving all disks. Without thinking through all of the details of each step, we know that the top disk\n",
    "on peg B must be moved at this point (since only top disks can be moved, and we do not want to\n",
    "move the disks on peg C, since they are currently in the correct position). So we can move the top\n",
    "disk from peg B to either currently empty peg A, or on top of the disks on peg C.<br>\n",
    "Note that this is the smallest disk of all disks. Therefore, once we place this smallest disk on\n",
    "either peg, that peg cannot be used to place any other disks on top of it . But the one insight we\n",
    "should have gained by working through the detailed solution of three disks is that there is always the\n",
    "need for a spare peg when moving a stack of disks from one peg to another. Thus, once the smallest\n",
    "disk is placed on a peg, that peg becomes unusable for placing any other disks on it (and thus unusable\n",
    "as a spare peg), as shown in Figure below for peg A.\n",
    "<img src=\"23.jpg\">\n",
    "Since we have determined that dividing the stack of disks into two (essentially) equal-size stacks\n",
    "will not work, we need to consider alternate methods of dividing the stack of disks. Suppose we take\n",
    "the opposite approach, and divide the stack into very unequal -sized stacks? That is, let’s consider\n",
    "dividing the stack so that the top stack consists of the top (smallest) disk only, and the bottom stack\n",
    "consists of the rest of the disks. Let’s see how this plays out.<br>\n",
    "Moving the top stack from peg A to peg B means moving the one smallest disk to peg B, as\n",
    "shown in Figure below.\n",
    "<img src=\"24.jpg\">\n",
    "That is easy, since it is a stack of only one! Now, we must (recursively) move the bottom stack (with\n",
    "all the remaining disks) from peg A to peg C. We know that this cannot be done in one step, and must\n",
    "be done by moving one disk at a time. We also know that in order to move such a stack of disks from\n",
    "any peg to any other peg, we must have a spare peg. However, since the smallest disk has been\n",
    "placed on peg B (our spare peg), that is unavailable for use! Again, then, this approach will not work!<br>\n",
    "Finally, we consider the correct approach. We again break down the stack of disks into very\n",
    "unequal-sized stacks. However, this time, we break it down so that the top stack consists of all disks\n",
    "except the bottom (largest) disk . Therefore, the correct approach would be to recursively move the\n",
    "top stack (of n - 1 disks) from peg A to peg B. Then, simply move the largest (remaining) disk from\n",
    "peg A to peg C. Then recursively move the stack of disks from peg B to peg C (on top of the largest\n",
    "disk), as shown in Figure below.\n",
    "<img src=\"25.jpg\">\n",
    "Note that in this case, when moving the stack of disks from peg B to peg C, we have the needed spare\n",
    "peg, since peg A is currently empty, and peg C has on it the largest disk, making it possible to use\n",
    "either as a spare peg. Thus, our recursive solution is:<br>\n",
    "Step 1: Recursively move the top n 2 1 disks from peg A to peg B.<br>\n",
    "Step 2: Move the one (remaining) largest disk from peg A to peg C.<br>\n",
    "Step 3: Recursively move the n 2 1 disks from peg B to peg C.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As with MergeSort, this is a doubly recursive algorithm. This is a well-designed recursive solution\n",
    "because:<br>\n",
    "♦ There is a base case . When the stack of disks consists of only one disk, such a “stack” can be\n",
    "moved without further breakdown.<br>\n",
    "♦ The recursive steps work towards the base case . The subproblem involves the solution of smaller\n",
    "and smaller sized stacks of disks.<br>\n",
    "♦ The solutions of the subproblems provide a solution for the original problem. Solutions of subproblems\n",
