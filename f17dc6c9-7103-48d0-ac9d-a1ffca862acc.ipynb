    "# MOTIVATION\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have limited ourselves to using only\n",
    "the most fundamental features of Python—\n",
    "variables, expressions, control structures,\n",
    "input/print, and lists. In theory, these are the\n",
    "only instructions needed to write any program\n",
    "(that is, to perform any computation).\n",
    "From a practical point-of-view, however,\n",
    "these instructions alone are not enough.\n",
    "The problem is one of complexity. Some\n",
    "smart phones, for example, contain over\n",
    "10 million lines of code (see Figure 5-1). Imagine\n",
    "the effort needed to develop and debug software\n",
    "of that size. It certainly cannot be implemented by\n",
    "any one person, it takes a team of programmers to\n",
    "develop such a project.\n",
    "In order to manage the complexity of a large problem, it is broken down into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "Then, each subproblem can be focused on and solved separately. In programming, we do the\n",
    "same thing. Programs are divided into manageable pieces called program routines (or simply routines\n",
    "). Doing so is a form of abstraction in which a more general, less detailed view of a system can\n",
    "be achieved. In addition, program routines provide the opportunity for code reuse, so that systems\n",
    "do not have to be created from “scratch.” Routines, therefore, are a fundamental building block in\n",
    "software development.In this chapter, we look at the definition and use of program routines in Python.\n",
    "<img src=\"01.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Routines\n",
    "We first introduce the notion of a program routine. We then look in particular at program routines in\n",
    "Python, called <i>functions</i> . We have already been using Python’s built-in functions such as len,\n",
    "range, and others. We now look more closely at how functions are used in Python, as well as how\n",
    "to define our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Function Routine?\n",
    "A routine is a named group of instructions performing some task. A routine can be <b>invoked</b> ( called )\n",
    "as many times as needed in a given program, as shown in Figure 5-2.\n",
    "<img src=\"02.jpg\">\n",
    "When a routine terminates, execution automatically returns to the point from which it was called.\n",
    "Such routines may be predefi ned in the programming language, or designed and implemented by the\n",
    "programmer.\n",
    "    A function is Python’s version of a program routine. Some functions are designed to return a\n",
    "value, while others are designed for other purposes. We look at these two types of functions next.\n",
    "> A program routine is a named group of instructions that accomplishes some task. A routine may\n",
    "be invoked (called) as many times as needed in a given program. A function is Python’s version\n",
    "of a program routine.\n",
    "### Defining Functions\n",
    "In addition to the built-in functions of Python, there is the capability to define new functions. Such\n",
    "functions may be generally useful, or specific to a particular program. The elements of a function\n",
    "definition are given in Figure 5-3.\n",
    "<img src=\"03.jpg\">\n",
    "The first line of a function definition is the function header . A function header starts with the keyword\n",
    "**def**, followed by an identifier (avg), which is the function’s name. The function name is\n",
    "followed by a comma-separated (possibly empty) list of identifiers (n1, n2, n3) called <b>formal\n",
    "parameters</b> , or simply “parameters.” Following the parameter list is a colon ( : ). Following the\n",
    "function header is the body of the function, a suite (program block) containing the function’s\n",
    "instructions. As with all suites, the statements must be indented at the same level, relative to the\n",
    "function header.\n",
    "    The number of items in a parameter list indicates the number of values that must be passed to\n",
    "the function, called actual arguments (or simply “arguments”), such as the variables num1, num2,\n",
    "and num3 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* num1 = 10\n",
    "* num2 = 25\n",
    "* num3 = 16\n",
    "* avg(num1,num2,num3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are generally defined at the top of a program. However, every function must be defined\n",
    "before it is called.\n",
    "We discuss more about function definition and use in the following sections.\n",
    ">Actual arguments, or simply “arguments,” are the values passed to functions to be operated on.\n",
    "Formal parameters, or simply “parameters,” are the “placeholder” names for the arguments\n",
    "passed."

    "### Value-Returning Functions\n",
    "A value-returning function is a program routine called for its return value, and is therefore similar\n",
    "to a mathematical function. Take the simple mathematical function f(x) = 2x. In this notation, “x”\n",
    "stands for any numeric value that function f may be applied to, for example, f(2) = 2x = 4. Program\n",
    "functions are similarly used, as illustrated in Figure 5-4.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Function avg takes three arguments (n1, n2, and n3) and returns the average of the three.\n",
    "The <i>function call</i> avg(10, 25, 16), therefore, is an expression that evaluates to the returned\n",
    "function value. This is indicated in the function’s return statement of the form return expr ,\n",
    "where expr may be any expression. Next, we look at a second form of program routine called for\n",
    "a purpose other than a returned function value.\n",
    "<img src=\"04.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Python Shell, first enter the following function, making sure to indent the code as given. Hit return\n",
