    "the data is physically structured, only how it is\n",
    "logically organized. Access is provided by a query language that allows arbitrarily complex queries\n",
    "to be made of the data. For example, one can construct a query that returns the set of students who\n",
    "have a perfect 4.0 GPA and are graduating at the end of the current semester. Or, one could construct\n",
    "a more complex query that returns the set of students that have a GPA of 3.6 or above, with senior\n",
    "status, female, a computer science major, and has taken at least twelve credits of biology or eight\n",

    "Some of the concerns of database management systems include: integrity of data—that is, data\n",
    "that is accessible and properly organized; security in the control of who has what level of access; and\n",
    "management of concurrency issues when multiple users are accessing the same data. Data mining\n",

    "### The Problem\n",
    "A food co-op in a university town found an\n",
    "interesting solution to a scheduling problem.\n",
    "The co-op offered two prices for everything—\n",
    "one price for members, and a higher price for\n",
    "nonmembers. To qualify for the lower prices,\n",
    "each member had to volunteer to work at the\n",
    "co-op for a couple hours each week.\n",
    "The problem was that the co-op needed\n",
    "two people to be working at all times. Members\n",
    "would be asked to sign up for time slots,\n",
    "limited to two workers for each slot. Too often, however, members who had signed up for a given time\n",
    "did not show up, leaving the co-op either completely or partially uncovered.\n",
    "The co-op eventually devised an effective, albeit daring solution to this problem. They decided\n",
    "to just let members come in to work whenever they wanted to, with no planned scheduling! This\n",
    "unscheduled approach ran the risk of there being times in which the co-op was left without any\n",
    "workers. What was interesting was that they found this approach to be a better solution than the\n",
    "scheduled approach. (We will look at whether this is also better for the individual members or not.)\n",

    "minutes late and/or leave a certain number of minutes early. The function, in turn, relies on the use of\n",
    "function eventOccurred, which is provided a probability value, and returns True or False to simulate whether the event has occurred or not. Function executeUnscheduledSimulation is\n",
    "designed similarly, except that it also needs to determine how many (unscheduled) workers decide to\n",
    "show up at their convenience. Thus, the function relies on function numWorkersShowedUp (which\n",

    "### Analyzing a Scheduled vs. Unscheduled Co-op Worker Approach\n",
    "We now look at the simulation results for worker coverage at the food co-op, one using a scheduled\n",
    "approach (Figure below), \n",
    "<img src=\"126_1.jpg\">\n",
    "<img src=\"126_2.jpg\">\n",
    "and the other using an unscheduled approach (Figure below).\n",
    "<img src=\"127_1.jpg\">\n",
    "<img src=\"127_2.jpg\">\n",
    "<img src=\"127_3.jpg\">\n",
    "We can compare these two simulation runs. Since each run is based on assumed probabilities\n",
    "of events, the results are only as accurate as the probability estimates. Also, multiple simulation\n",
    "runs would provide a more accurate picture of likely events. Comparative results are given in\n",
    "Figure below.\n",
    "<img src=\"128_1.jpg\">\n",
    "So with these caveats in mind , what can we conclude from this simulation? We first look at\n",
    "the reason that the food co-op chose to try an unscheduled approach—that too often, time slots\n",
    "were left partially or completely uncovered. From our simulation of a scheduled approach, we\n",
    "do see three times in which time slots are completely uncovered, and fourteen times in which\n",
    "there is only partial coverage (that is, only one person showing up). In the simulation of the\n",
    "unscheduled approach, there were no time slots left uncovered, and only three time slots in\n",
    "which there was partial coverage. This, therefore, coincides with the co-op’s experience that\n",
    "there is better coverage in an unscheduled approach.\n",
    "We next focus on the number of times a worker was 15 or 30 minutes late. In the scheduled\n",
    "approach, members were 15 minutes late six times, 30 minutes late two times, and 45 minutes late\n",
    "one time. For the unscheduled approach, members were 15 minutes late six times, 30 minutes late\n",
    "three times, and never 45 minutes late. Thus, there is no appreciable difference in the amount of time\n",
    "workers arrive late based on the simulation. When we look at the number of times workers left early,\n",
    "we see that in the scheduled approach, workers left 15 minutes early three times and 30 minutes\n",
    "early four times. In the unscheduled approach, workers left 15 minutes early four times, and\n",
    "30 minutes early only once. Thus, there is also no appreciable difference in the amount of times\n",
    "workers leave early, except that scheduled workers were more likely to leave 30 minutes early than\n",
    "unscheduled workers (based on our assumed probabilities of human behavior).\n",
    "Overall, the results indicate that an unscheduled approach does improve the problem of uncovered\n",
    "time slots. This, therefore, improves the functioning of the co-op. However, is there a hidden\n",
    "cost to this? A downside of the unscheduled approach is that there are times when more than the two workers show up. Thus, there are expected to be times when members who show up to work are\n",
    "not needed, and therefore need to return another time. In our simulation, this happened 77 times,\n",
    "which depending on other factors (for example, how long it takes to get to the co-op, how far out of\n",
    "the way is it from other locations that members would typically go to, etc.) is an additional burden\n",
    "on individual members.\n",
    "Thus, it is understandable from the co-op’s point of view that an unscheduled approach to\n",
    "worker “scheduling” is a better approach. However, for individual members it adds an extra burden\n",
    "of time, and thus it may not be considered an improvement from their perspective."
